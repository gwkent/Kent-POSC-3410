# Call mpg_data
mpg_data
# Describe the output you see in the console.
Empty box, no plot
Now, let us add an aesthetic layer to the plot.
# Put engine size on the x-axis, highway mileage on y-axis, and color by class.
mpg_plot<-mpg_data +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ , y=hwy, color=class))
# Call mpg_plot.
mpg_plot
# What do you see?
Looks like the graph used earlier; gray graph with a y axis of highway mileage, an x axis of engine size, colored by class
# Now, let's add an aesthetic layer to change the axis labels
mpg_axis <- mpg_plot +
  xlab("Engine Size in Liters")+
  ylab("Highway Mileage")+
  ggtitle("Engine Size and Mileage by Vehicle Class")
# Call mpg_axis
mpg_axis
# What do you see?
Same graph, but with a title and better x and y axis labels
# Create different graphs for each class
mpg_wrap<-mpg_axis +
  facet_wrap(~class, nrow=2)
# Call mpg_wrap
mpg_wrap
# What do you see?
Seven graphs, each graphing out one class of vehicle by highway mileage and engine size
# Re-assign mpg_wrap by adding facet wrapping, change nrow to 3.
mpg_wrap<-mpg_wrap +
  facet_wrap(~class, nrow=3)
mpg_wrap<-mpg_wrap +
  facet_wrap(~class, nrow=2)
mpg_wrap
# What do you see?
I cant quite tell the difference between these graphs and the previous ones. They appear to be oriented more horizontally, with the bases of the graphs now wider than the heights.
